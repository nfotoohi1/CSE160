        Shadows: The shadows are visible if you turn the camera all the way around to view the back of the smile.
        To see the effect of the shadows, play with the two light controls.
      </div>
      <div style="position: absolute; top: 510px;">
        Fog: The effect of the fog can be seen if you turn the camera far away from either the moon or the sun.
        You can also see its effect if you pay with the Fog Controls.
      </div>
      <div style="position: absolute; top: 540px;">
        Raycasting: It's pretty easy to see that the raycasting is there, but try to not brush the mouse over the
        3D object because then the raycasting stops working and you have to refresh for it to work.
      </div>
      <div style="position: absolute; top: 570px;">
        The 3D Object Plant is textured. It's just textured weirdly, it's not my fault.
        Also ignore the blob, even though the blob was not invited.
